# INBS-calculators
A set of calculator scripts for the INBS lab at U of T. This library may grow and change over time, but currently it is 
a set of scripts and functions that are useful in nanoparticle synthesis. Each script has help text, accessible by the -h
flag. Furthermore, each file has thorough comments which explain what is happening and why. Any questions or concerns can be
raised in the Issues section on this webpage.

NP_area.py and NR_area.py are designed to be run from the command line. To use them, clone the library to your destination of
choice. Using a command line program (such as Terminal on Mac, or git bash on Windows), navigate to the library location. Once
there, type "python <filename>.py -h" to pull up the file help text. This will guide you through use of the files.
