# INBS-calculators
A set of calculator scripts for the INBS lab at U of T. This library may grow and change over time, but currently it is 
a set of scripts and functions that are useful in nanoparticle synthesis. Each script has help text, accessible by the -h
flag. Furthermore, each file has thorough comments which explain what is happening and why. Any questions or concerns can be
raised in the Issues section on this webpage.
